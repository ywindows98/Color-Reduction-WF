Maybe choose random colors from the image(number of colors), find closest to them. Reduce with this chosen pallete. ++

Add some limit to the number of colors on the color reduction stage  
How to reduce to a more specific number???
Maybe 1-2-4-8-16 sectors. Find the most common in sector. Than for next sectors. If most common in the sector already has been chosen, choose next one?
---
Or try find most distant color - add, find next most distant from those two - repeat(maybe each color paradigm has to be respresented by 2 closest colors?)
--
Process image once using entire color base. Than try choose N random points to be main classes(colors) and process it again using only those colors?

Add choosing some colors? Points on the image with colors you would like to be used(closest to them would be chosen from the allowed base). ++

Add processed image saving.

Add smoothing out 

Add lines generation and sector cleaning
Add color-number generation
Add number generation on the plot
